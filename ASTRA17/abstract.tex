\begin{abstract}
Modern robotic development frameworks have agreed upon the model-based, component-centric software development approach. Composing robotic control software has become an easier and less error-prone task. While there is a model for the software architecture and – fairly recently – a model for the kinematical structure of robotic systems, models for other aspects are missing. This paper will focus on the model of heterogeneous computational resources and their interconnection within a robot and outline how tools make use of the models to generate code skeletons in different languages, find compatible implementations of algorithms given a specific target and to map a network of software to a network of hardware components.
